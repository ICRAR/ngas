# The Docker-ized build environment creates a very long hostname
# (~100 chars long), but the NGAS database schema's host_id column
# has a maximum width of 32, which is why we set a specific hostname.
# Also, we need the bsddb development headers almost always
#

#
# We build and test NGAS against three different DB engines
#
#  * SQLite3 (linux and OSX)
#  * MySQL
#  * PostgreSQL
#
# In the latter two cases we need to install some extra system-level packages
# in order to install (later, in the run_build.sh script) the corresponding
# python PEP-249-compliant modules.
#
# Setting the DB environment variable allows us to keep track later on which
# database engine this particular run is based on
