                             (e.g. files to be handled).

    ActualCount:             The current number of iterations done (e.g. files
                             handled).

    EstTotalTime:            The complete (estimated) time for carrying out the
                             request. Given in the format: HH:MM:SS.
 
    RemainingTime:           The (estimated) remaining time for carrying out  
                             the request. Given in the format: HH:MM:SS.
