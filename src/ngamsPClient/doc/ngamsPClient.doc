                         is ignored.

<Generic Par Array>:     Array consisting of the parameters + values for
                         these to be provided with the command. This is
                         given in the format:

                           -par <Parameter> [-val <Val>] [-par <Parameter ...]

                         The name of the parameter must actually be the
                         HTTP name as used by NG/AMS, e.g. to retrieve a
                         file using the RETRIEVE command:

                           -par file_id -val MyFile -par version -val 2

                         Note, using the generic parameter specification,
                         the API is not providing any support to the user
                         (application) when it comes to checking the
                         correctness of the parameters specified. Errors will
                         be sent back by the NG/AMS Server in case a request
                         could not be handled. Not all commands can be
                         executed using the generic interface. It is for
                         instance not possible to execute an Archive Push
                         Request.

-cfg:                    Refers to the NG/AMS Configuration.

<Cmd Spec Pars>:         The command specific parameters are:

-diskId <Disk ID>:       Refers to a specific disk.

-execute:                Execute an action.

-fileId <ID>:            Refers to a specific file.

-fileUri <URI>:          URI pointing to the file to be archived.

                           file:/home/data/Image1.fits

                         This will result in an Archive Pull Request. It can
                         also be given directly as a filename, e.g.:

                           /home/data/Image1.fits

                         This will result in an Archive Push Request.

-fileVersion <Version>:  Refers to a specific File Version of a file.

-filterPlugIn ...:       Reference to a Filter Plug-In to apply in connection
                         with handling the request.

-force:                  Force an action.

-hostId:                 Used to refer to a specific NGAS Host within the
                         query data. I.e., it is possible to retrieve an
                         internal file from a specific host.

-internal <Filename>:    Refer to an NG/AMS 'internal file'.

-mimeType <Mime-Type>:   If it is not possible to determine the mime-type of
                         a data file from the filename, the mime-type must
                         be explicitly given with the ARCHIVE command.

-ngLog:                  Refers to the Local Log File used by NG/AMS.

-notifEmail:             List of comma separated email recipients that will
                         be informed via email about the execution/status
                         of the command.

-outputFile ...:         Directory or file in which to dump a file when
                         retrieving files.

-path <Path>:            Specifies a path, which should be taken into
                         account when carrying out the request.

-priority <Prio>:        Priority. Used by Subscribers to give another
                         priority than the default one (10). A low number
                         means a high priority.

-processing <DDPI>:      Name of Data Processing Plug-In to execute on the
                         data before sending it back to the requestor.

-processingPars <Pars>:  Optional parameters to be handed over to the DPPI.
                         These should normally be given on the format:

                           par1=val,par2=val2,...

                         - although it is up to the DPPI to interpret these.

-slotId <ID>:            Slot ID for which to generate label.

-startDate ...:          Date in ISO8601 format indicating a lower limit
                         in time.

-targetDiskId <ID>:      Target disk to be used e.g. for archiving or
                         cloning a file.

-url <URL>:              URL. Used for the SUBSCRIBE command to indicate
                         to where NG/AMS should deliver data subscribed for.
                         
-nexturl <URL>:          Used with the PARCHIVE command to specify the next
                         destination where the file will be archived
                         
-sndbuf <BUF_SIZE>:	  TCP send/receive buffer size, e.g. 2097152
                         set to the BDP value for high latency links
