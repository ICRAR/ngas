    Synopsis:
    Data Consistency Checking Thread.

    Description:
    This Test Suite exercises the Data Consistency Checking facility.
    It is verified that the various checks are properly functioning, and that
    the DCC Thread is robust towards various errors that might occur.

    Missing Test Cases:
    This Test Suite is very basic. A thorough review should be done and the
    missing Test Cases added.

    In particular Test Cases for detecting the various points checked should
    be added.

        Synopsis:
        Basic functioning of Data Checking Feature.

        Description:
        Test Test the basic functioning of the Data Check Thread. The
        Data Check Thread is started and it is checked that it performs
        a cycle whereby all files are checked, and a Data Check Entry is
        logged into the NG/AMS Local Log File.

        Expected Result:
        After a given period of time, the DCC Thread should have completed
        one check cycle and have detected possible problems. In this case
        there are no inconsistencies found.

        Test Steps:
        - Start standard NG/AMS Server configured to carry out DCC
          continuosly.
        - Archive a small file 3 times.
        - Wait until the DCC has finished one cycle (NGAMS_INFO_DATA_CHK_STAT
          log written in the log file).
        - Check that the report is OK/that all files were checked.
