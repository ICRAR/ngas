<!--
  The Server Element defines properties for the individual
  installation of NG/AMS.

  Attributes:
    ArchiveName:            Name of the archive - e.g. ESO-VLT.

    PortNo:                 Port number to use for the NG/AMS HTTP server.

    SwVersion:	            If defined, NG/AMS will compare the value of
                            this attribute with the version ID of NG/AMS.
                            If these are not completely identical an error
                            is reported and the NG/AMS Server will perform
                            an exit. If the SwVersion is not specified
                            (set to ""), this check is not done.

    BlockSize:              Block size applied when receiving and
                            sending data via HTTP (bytes).

    Simulation:             Simulation system "1" otherwise "0".

    MaxSimReqs:             Maximum number of simultaneous requests that
                            the server should be capable of handling.
			    If more are received, these will be rejected.

    RootDirectory:          NGAS home directory.

    VolumeDirectory:        Location of NGAS data volumes. The given directory
                            will be appended to the NGAS Root Directory.

    ProxyMode:              If a server which is contacted with a Retrieve
                            Request, finds a file to be retrieved, on
                            another NGAS Host, it will act as proxy and
                            send back the file to the requestor if possible.

<!--
  The StorageSet Element defines properties for each 'storage unit',
  consisting of two disks (Main Disk and Replication Disk).

  Attributes:
    StorageSetId:       ID used to refer to this particular
                        storage unit (string).

    DiskLabel:          Name of label prefix to put on the

    MainDiskSlotId:     Slot ID for Main Disk (string).

    RepDiskSlotId:      Slot ID for Replication Disk (string).

    Mutex:              Indicates if mutual exclusion access should be
                        enforced to the disks. If this is enabled, only
                        one data reception session will write data to
                        that slot (disk), and not simultaneous as otherwise
                        done if several files for the same disk is received
                        at the same time. 1 = mutual exclusion (integer).

    Synchronize:        The synchronize flag is used to indicate if the two
                        disks of a set should be considerd as locked
                        together so that when one is completed also
                        the other is marked as completed although it

  The DataCheckThread Element defines properties for the file handling.

  Attributes:
   ChecksumPlugIn:        DCPI - Data Checksum Plug-In, which generates the
                          checksum of a data file.

   ChecksumPlugInPars:    Input parameters to the DCPI.

   Active:                Enable/disable Data Check Service (1 = activate).

   ForceNotif:            If set to 1, an Notification Message will always
                          be sent out when a checking cycle has finished,
			  also if no discrepancies were encountered.

   MaxProcs:              Specify the maximum number of parallel sub-processes
                          are allowed to carry out the data checking.

   Scan:                  If set to 1, only a scan of the data holding is
                          carried out. This means that it is checked if the
                          files are accessible and if their size are OK.
			  The checksum is not calculated however.

   Prio:                  Priority of Data Check Thread (1 = highest priority).
                          with this parameter it is possible to adjust the
                          amount of CPU power the Data Check Thread should
                          consume. The higher the number, the lesser CPU
                          the check will consume. At the same time, it
                          will take more time to carry out the check of
                          the data holding.

   MinCycle:              Indicates the minimum allowed time for carrying out
                          one check cycle (ddThh:mm:ss). If this is specified
                          e.g. to 24 hours, and one check cycle would only
                          take 11 hours, the check would be suspended for
                          13 hours before running again.

   DiskSeq:               Used to indicate if disks should be checked
                          sequentially (ordered according to the Slot
                          ID), or randomly (SEQUENTIAL|RANDOM).

   FileSeq:               Used to indicate if files on a disk should be checked
                          sequentially (ordered according to the ingestion
                          date), or randomly (SEQUENTIAL|RANDOM).

   LogSummary:            If set to 1, a summary log info will be generated
                          each time a complete check of the data holding
                          of one NGAS Host has been carried out.
