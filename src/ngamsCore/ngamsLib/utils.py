    """
    A task that runs on the background. The task (a function) can be executed
    either on a separate thread (default) or in a separate process depending
    on the `mode` argument given at construction time.

    To enable interruption, at `start` time the target functions are called with
    an extra parameter in *args containing an event object, which is set at
    `stop` time. This event object therefore allows target functions know when
    they should stop working. This stop event is stored in its `stop_evt` member,
    and is generated automatically by this class unless the `stop_evt` argument
    is specified at construction time. This should allow the creation of multiple
    Task objects sharing a single stopping event.

    Since Tasks use interruptions based on events, "process" Tasks set their
    signal handlers to a no-operation function. This firstly detaches them from
    any previous handler set by the parent process, and allows them to cleanly
    continue running after a signal arrives.
