"""
Class implementing a manager service to control a number of threads running
in parallel, carrying out the same task.

Note, after object creation the threads will be paused and will first start
execution when the method start() is called.

It is possible to request the threads to suspend themselves by calling the
pause() method.

The function which will be invoked as a thread, should have the following
interface:

def myThread(threadGroupObj)

The body of the thread function should typically be of structured as follows:

    while (True):
        threadGroupObj.checkPauseStop()

        # ... business logic ...

        threadGroupObj.suspend()


If the business logic of the thread can be split into logical blocks, with
a 'significant' execution time, it should be considered to call the
checkPauseStop() method between such blocks.

The suspend() method makes the thread suspend itself for a period of time
according to the following rules:

  - If the loop period parameter is specified the thread suspends itself
    for a period of time such that the total execution time one iteration,
    is constant. I.e., specifying this parameter correctly, it is possible to
    obtain a certain real-time behavior of the thread execution.

  - If the loop suspension parameter is specified, the execution of the loop
    will be suspended for this period of time. This suepension time is counted
    as part of the total loop execution time.


General mutual exclusion is obtained in the thread function business logic
code by calling the methods takeGenMux()/releaseGenMux(). Note, care should
be taken not to exagerate the usage of this semaphore, as if used too
frequently, the threads may block eachother unnecessarily.
