NGAS Command Plug-In, implementing an Archive Command specific for Mirroring

This works in a similar way as the 'standard' ARCHIVE Command, but has been simplified in a few ways:

* No replication to a Replication Volume is carried out.
* Target disks are selected randomly, disregarding the Streams/Storage Set mappings in the configuration. This means
that 'volume load balancing' is provided.
* Archive Proxy Mode is not supported.
* No probing for storage availability is supported.
* In general, less SQL queries are performed and the algorithm is more light-weight.
* crc is computed from the incoming stream
* ngas_files data is 'cloned' from the source file
