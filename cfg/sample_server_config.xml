Sample configuration file distributed with NGAS.

This file pretends to show users how a server is configured, and all the
knobs and levers that can be toggled to change the behaviour of the server.
It offers secure default values for most options, so it should be safe to use
as a starting point to write your own configuration files.

Each high-level XML element contains a description of what topic it covers,
and which attributes and values are accepted.

For more information on the configuration options, visit NGAS's documentation at

https://ngas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/


Quick-start
===========

To quickly adapt this file to your needs:

 * Adjust the Server.RootDirectory attribute to your NGAS root directory
 * Adjust the Server.ArchiveName to a meaningful name for your archive
 * Adjust the <Db> XML element to point to your database


About time amounts
==================

Some time amounts are expresed using a DTHH:mm:ss format, with D, HH, mm and ss
representing days, hours, minutes and seconds, respectivelly. A shorter version
is also accepted in the form of HH:mm (without :ss). Because this is confusing
future versions of NGAS will not support this format anymore, and will change
to simply use seconds everywhere. Once this change takes effect the old format
will still be supported for a few versions, but warning messages will appear so
users update their configuration files.


About secrets
=============

Some secrets (like Authorization passwords) are expressed in this configuration
file using base64 encoding. This will change in future versions of NGAS, where
passwords will be expressed literally.

	<!--
	    Server configuration.

	    The NGAS HTTP server listens for requests in the address indicated
	    by the IpAddress/PortNo pair, and attends up to MaxSimReqs simultaneous
	    requests. It acts as a proxy for requests that must be answered by other
	    servers in the same cluster if ProxyMode is set; otherwise clients receive
	    a redirect response instead.

	    Any disk found by the server will be considered as being part of the
	    abstract archive ArchiveName. Access to the disk, plus other block-based
	    operations performed by the server (e.g., network read/write and
	    checksum calculation) will be performed using BlockSize block size.

	    Finally, a list of colon-separated directories containing python
	    packages and modules can be specified using the PluginsPath attribute.
	    This directories will be added to the sys.path of the NGAS server,
	    allowing users to install their own code separately from the NGAS
	    installation, which might not even be writable.

	<!--
	    Logging configuration

	    The NGAS server outputs its logging to three different sinks:
	    the stdout, a (rotating) logfile, and syslog.

	    The stdout output is not configured but via a command-line parameter.
	    In a real-world setup the NGAS server will run in the background,
	    so there is no point on configuring stdout logging here.

	    Logfile output is configured via LocalLogFile, which indicates the
	    logfile. Statements with level <= LocalLogLevel appear in the logfile.
	    The logfile is rotated with a LogRotateInt interval (expressed as ddTHH:mm:ss),
	    and LogRotateCache files are maintained before they start getting
	    deleted.

	    Syslog output is enabled if SysLog is 1. Statements are prefixed with
	    SysLogPrefix before sent to syslog.

	    Logging levels are interpreted like this:
	    0 = NONE, 1 = ERROR, 2 = WARNING, 3 = NOTICE, 4 = INFO, 5 = DEBUG.

	    The flag ArchiveRotatedLogfiles controls whether the rotated log files
	    are archived (=1) on the host or not (=0).
	-->

	     LogRotateCache="30" LogRotateInt="01T00:00:00" SysLog="0"

	<!--
	    Archiving configuration

	    The FreeSpaceDiskChangeMb and MinFreeSpaceWarningMb specify how much
	    available free space in the disks will trigger an error to change the
	    disk, and a warning email alerting about the condition, respectivelly.
	    The PathPrefix is the top-level directory on each volume under which
	    NGAS will store incoming data. Data will be replicated during archiving
	    from the Main disk to a Replication disk if Replication is set to 1.

	    If BackLogBuffering is set to 1, then failures during ARCHIVE commands
	    *might* be resolved automatically by NGAS asynchronously. In such
	    situations, backlogged data sits temporarily in the
	    BackLogBufferDirectory.
	-->
	<ArchiveHandling Id="ArchiveHandling"

	             AllowRemoveReq="1" AllowRetrieveReq="1"/>

	<!--
	    Database connectivity

	    NGAS uses the PEP-249-compliant module indicated by Interface to
	    connect to the central database. This driver is wrapped by a
	    connection pool, which will hold a maximum of MaxPoolConnections
	    connections. When a new connection is established by the pool to
	    the database server, the SQL statements specified in the sql attribute
	    of the SessionSql XML sub-elements are executed. This could be useful,
	    for instance, to switch to a different database before running any
	    queries, if required, but could be used for other purposes.

	    Because of historical reasons, some database schemas had a "ignore"
	    column in the ngas_files table rather than a "file_ignore" column.
	    If you are creating a database from scratch, you should prefer
	    "file_ignore" (which is what we use in the SQL scripts we ship with
	    NGAS to create databases from scratch), but if you have an existing
	    database with "ignore" you can still configure NGAS to use that name.
	    The UseFileIgnore attribute controls this. It defaults to "true",
	    in which case "file_ignore" will be used throughout the code;
	    otherwise "ignore" will be used instead.

	    The Snapshot attribute should be considered unsafe, and (unless you
	    know exactly what you are doing) should be left set to "0".

	    Any other parameter will be used verbatim as keyword arguments
	    to the connect method of the PEP-249 driver.

	    Example: If the central database is a PostgreSQL server, and is
	             using the old "ignore" column name one can setup this element
	             to be:

	      <Db Id="Db" Snapshot="0" Interface="psycopg2" UseFileIgnore="false"
	          host="db-server.example.com" dbname="db-name" user="db-user"
	          password="password"/>
	-->
	<Db Id="Db-Element" Snapshot="0" Interface="sqlite3"
	    MaxPoolConnections="5" UseFileIgnore="true"
	    database="/tmp/ngas.sqlite"/>

	<!--
	    E-mail notification setup

	    Under certain circumstances emails can be sent by NGAS to different
	    recipients. Notifications are sent to the SmtpHost SMTP server, and
	    appear as sent by Sender. Depending on the event generating the email,
	    one of the addresses will be used. Email sending can be disabled,
	    although even when disabled some notifications (that are considered
	    too important to be missed) will still be sent.

	    If messages cannot be sent for any reason, they are kept internally
	    by NGAS for a maximum of time defined by MaxRetentionTime, or until
	    MaxRetentionSize messages are hit.

	    Configures the Janitor service.

	    The Janitor service runs a number of house-keeping tasks in the
	    background with a given period (specified via SuspensionTime).

	    One of the tasks of the Janitor service is the check that the
	    filesystems where files are being stored in have enough space to
	    keep storing new files (and if not, send the server to OFFLINE
	    state). This behavior is controlled via the MinSpaceSysDirMb
	    attribute, which indicates how much space should always be available
	    on each filesystem.

	    Users can also specify extra functionality to be run during each
	    janitor iteration. To do this, PlugIn XML sub-elements can be defined
	    inside the JanitorThread element, each specifying a Name attribute
	    pointing to a fully-qualified python module name. See NGAS's
	    documentation for more details.

	<!--
	    Caching control configuration

	    If enabled (Enable="1"), the caching control service automatically
	    removes data from the server when certain criteria are met.

	    Files are removed from the cache if any of the following is true
	    for them: 1) they have been in the cache for more than a specified
	    maximum time, expressed in seconds (e.g., MaxTime="86400" for a full
	    day), 2) the total volume of files in the cache has reached the
	    specified limit (e.g., MaxCacheSize="1099511627776" to specify 1 TBs),
	    3) a maximum number of files has been reached (e.g., MaxFiles="1000"
	    for a maximum caching of 1000 files), and 4) A user-specific plugin,
	    specified via the CacheControlPlugIn (a fully-qualified python module
	    name) and the CacheControlPlugInPars parameters, which determines
	    whether a particular file should be deleted or not.

	    If any of these attributes is missing, the corresponding criterion
	    is not applied. In the case of MaxCacheSize and MaxFiles, eligible
	    files are selected FIFO-wise; that is, older files are removed first.

	    On top of all the above, if the Subscription service is enabled files
	    will only be eligible for deletion after they are successfully
	    transmitted to all their subscribers. At the moment this is
	    specified by setting CheckCanBeDeleted="1", but in future releases
	    this will change and the behaviour will be implicit.

	    Data Checker Thread configuration

	    database. A summary report will be generated at the end and e-mailed
	    to the corresponding recipient (see the Notification configuration
	    element) if there are errors, or if the ForceNotif attribute is
	    set to 1.

	    The data checker thread can also be configured to perform a simple file
	    scanning check (if Scan is "1") instead of a full checksum calculation
	    and comparison.

	    The ChecksumPlugIn and ChecksumPlugInPars attributes should be ignored,
	    as they are superseeded by the ArchiveHandling.CRCVariant configuration
	    variable. They will be removed in future releases.
